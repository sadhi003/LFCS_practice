Here diffrent commands are include while practicing for exam.

1. Start to make partition and add users:
    >> add user on the user account using the following command
        useradd -d /home/testuser testuser
        cat /etc/group
        passwd testuser # assign the password for user
        cd /home 
        mkdir testuser # make home directory for testuser
        chown testuser:testuser testuser  # transfer ownership to the added user
        exit  ; exit out of root user
        su -i testuser  # change user to the testuser 
        
        
  >> another way of adding user:
      adduser testuser1
      # add all the information along with password; make an user account
    
  >> in order to delete the account and all its remnants
      userdel -r user_account
      
>>  add group 
    cd /etc/
    addgroup group_name
    groupadd group_name
    cat group  # see group_id 
    newgrp group_name  # to change group 
    chgrp group_1 group_2
    
>> sudo command and user previlage for sudo 
    if you are a superuser use command 
      sudo su -   # do not need password to login as root user
      # change one user to another of super user 
      sudo su - user_account_name
      
      
>> there is a 3rd method of adding a user manually; which can be done editing vigr inside /etc/ and vipw too.
    copy everything from skel to the useraccount.
      
      
>> Manage user processes
    #  look process
    top or htop
    # to see all the process on user and on the system is
    ps 
    ps aux
    ps axjf  # tree format
    # get the PID for process
    pgrep process_name
    ps aux | grep process_name
    # kill process
    kill -9 process_name # by owner of the process (9 is signal number)
    # kill does not mean always kill the processes but is the signal sending process
    kill -HUP process_id
    # to change priority of the process 
    renice priority_number PID
>>  User account properties 
    chfn # change different attributes of user
    chsh # to change into different shell on user account
    # close any of the account from login
    chsh user_account > /bin/false
    chsh user_account > /usr/sbin/nologin
    
    
>>  Partition of disk
    In order to see the partition on GUI
        sudo gpated
    To work from command line multiple disk utilities 
        df  # see free spaces
        sudo fdisk -l  # look into the different partition disk and memory used
        sudo fdisk /dev/sda1   # for making partition
            different command give different things 
            such as m,l,p
        hit n to start partitioning 
    -> after partition has been completed, need to mount that partition 
    by developing filesystem.
    mkfs -t ext4 /dev/partition_name
    # mount to the device by creating the disk space 
    mkdir /mnt/name_of_dir
    # now mount from root user as
    mount -t ext4 /dev/partition_name /mnt/name_of_dir
    # now unmount by 
    umount /mnt/name_of_dir
    # see the file system table to manage mounted file to boot 
    sudo vim /etc/fstab
    
    # set up logical volume group
    fdisk /dev/sda1   # apply on disk sda1
       : open different option here with m hit
       : n -> p -> 1 -> default -> default -> (type) t -> (linux LVM) 8e -> v -> w
       : do this for multiple partition on diffrent drive
    # make logical volume partition addding all drives
    pvcreate sda1 sda2 sda3     # pv stands for physical volume
    pvremove /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3
    pvdisplay # to display physical volume
    # make group of physical volume 
    vgcreate myvolume 1 2 3_physical_volume
    vgscan # read volumes
    vgrename   # rename the physical volume
