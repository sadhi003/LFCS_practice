1. Start to make partition and add users:
    >> add user on the user account using the following command
        useradd -d /home/testuser testuser
        cat /etc/group
        passwd testuser # assign the password for user
        cd /home 
        mkdir testuser # make home directory for testuser
        chown testuser:testuser testuser  # transfer ownership to the added user
        exit  ; exit out of root user
        su -i testuser  # change user to the testuser 
        
        
  >> another way of adding user:
      adduser testuser1
      # add all the information along with password; make an user account
    
  >> in order to delete the account and all its remnants
      userdel -r user_account
      
>>  add group 
    cd /etc/
    addgroup group_name
    groupadd group_name
    cat group  # see group_id 
    newgrp group_name  # to change group 
    chgrp group_1 group_2
    
>> sudo command and user previlage for sudo 
    if you are a superuser use command 
      sudo su -   # do not need password to login as root user
      # change one user to another of super user 
      sudo su - user_account_name
